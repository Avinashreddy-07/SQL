SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive. ex: SELECT is same as select.

SELECT - extracts data from a database

select * from actor

select Customername, City 
from Customers;

DISTINCT - used to return only unique values.

select distinct amount
from payment;

SELECT DISTINCT Country 
FROM Customers;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) AS Distinct_countries
FROM Costomers;

WHERE Clause - used to filter records.

select *
from actor
where first_name like 'G%';
order by last_name asc;

SELECT * 
FROM Customers
WHERE Country ='Mexico';

Operations used in WHERE Clause:
 =,<,>,>=,<=,<>(not equal),BETWEEN,LIKE(Search for a pattern),IN
 
ORDER BY - Sort the result 

SELECT * 
FROM Products
ORDER BY ProductName ASC|DESC 
 
AND Operator

SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' AND CustomerName LIKE 'G%';

OR Operator

SELECT *
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Spain' 
AND ( CustomerName LIKE 'G%' OR CustomerName LIKE 'R%');

NOT Operator

NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 60 
NOT IN ('paris','London')
NOT CustomerID > 50
NOT LIKE 'A%'

INSERT INTO - statement is used to insert new records in a table.

INSERT INTO Customers( CustomerName, City, Country)
VALUES
('Cardi', 'Liverpool', 'UK'),
('Tom', 'Sandes', 'Norway'),
('jane', 'Stavanger', 'Norway');

UPDATE - statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.

UPDATE Customers
SET ContactName = 'Alfred smith', City = 'Berlin'
WHERE CustomerID = 1;

DELETE - statement is used to delete existing records in a table.

DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CostomerName = 'Alfred Smith'
DELETE Customer -- Delete all rows in a table, without deleting the table.

DROP TABLE Customers -- To DELETE the Table completly use DROP TABLE

LIMIT - this clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

SELECT * FROM Customers 
LIMT 3;

MIN(), MAX()

LIKE - used in a WHERE clause to search for specified pattern in a column.

% sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters.
_ sign represents one single character.

SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20
AND CategoryID IN (1,2,3);

GROUP BY - groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find
the number of customers in each country."

It is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG())

HAVING clause was added to SQl because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with 
Aggerate functions.
